## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version)
*   Git
*   Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/EcoSteps.git
cd EcoSteps
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This command will install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase

This project requires a Firebase project to handle the backend.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password method).
3.  Enable **Firestore Database**.
   *   Navigate to the **Rules** tab and paste the following secure rules, then click **Publish**:
    ```rules
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /users/{userId} {
          allow read, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == userId;
          allow create: if request.auth.uid != null;
        }
        match /users/{userId}/activities/{activityId} {
          allow create, read: if request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
4.  From your project settings, create a new **Web App** and copy the `firebaseConfig` keys.
5.  In the root of this project, create a file named `.env`.
6.  Paste your Firebase keys into this new file. **(This file is in `.gitignore` to protect your keys!)**
    ```dotenv
    FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
    FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
    FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-messaging-sender-id"
    FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
    ```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the Metro bundler. It's recommended to clear the cache on the first run to ensure all dependencies are loaded correctly.
```bash
npx expo start -c
```
Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone.

## Key Learnings & Future Improvements

This project was an excellent exercise in building a data-driven, motivational mobile application. Key takeaways include:

*   **State Management with Hooks:** Combining React state with custom hooks (`useCarbonCalculator`) for clean and reusable business logic.
*   **Secure Backend Logic:** Implementing Firestore security rules to protect user data and ensure privacy.
*   **Motivational UI/UX:** Designing a dashboard that not only presents data but also encourages positive behavior through gamification elements like streaks and goals.

### Future Ideas:

*   [ ] **Dark Mode:** Implement a theme context to provide full dark mode support.
*   [ ] **Advanced Tracking:** Add categories for water usage and waste management.
*   [ ] **Carbon Offsetting:** Integrate with a service like Patch.io to allow users to offset their monthly footprint.
*   [ ] **Community Features:** Add leaderboards and team challenges to foster a sense of community.
